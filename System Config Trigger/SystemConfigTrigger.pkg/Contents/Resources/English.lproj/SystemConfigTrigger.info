Title System Configuration Trigger
Version 
Description This package will install an additional policy trigger onto client machines that are managed by the Casper Suite.  The policy trigger will check for policies whenever a system configuration changes.  This includes network changes.  For example, when changing from a wireless to a wired network, the client will then check up on the JSS to see if there are any policies in scope for the "SystemConfigTrigger" trigger.
